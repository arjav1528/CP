 * Testcase Example:  '[-1,2,1,-4]\n1'
 *
 * Given an integer array arr of length n and an integer target, find three
 * integers in arr such that the sum is closest to target.
 * 
 * Return the sum of the three integers.
 * 
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [0,0,0], target = 1
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 =
 * 0).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 3 <= arr.length <= 500
 * -1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000
 * -10^4 <= target <= 10^4
 *
